# Day 4 – Sorting

## Focus
Learning sorting as a preprocessing and problem-solving tool, and understanding
when full sorting is required versus partial ordering or partitioning.

## Concepts Covered
- Comparison-based sorting
- In-place vs out-of-place sorting
- Stability in sorting
- Partial sorting and selection

## Patterns Covered
- Sorting
- Partitioning
- Divide and Conquer

## Problems Solved

### Core Concept
- Sorting basics using standard algorithms

### LeetCode Problems
- 912 – Sort an Array
- 75 – Sort Colors
- 215 – Kth Largest Element in an Array

## Key Learnings
- Sorting often simplifies downstream logic
- Not all problems require full sorting
- Partition-based approaches can improve efficiency
