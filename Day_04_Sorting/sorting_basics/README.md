# Sorting Basics

## Problem
Sort an array of integers in ascending order.

## Approach
Use a standard comparison-based sorting algorithm to reorder elements.

## Pattern Used
Sorting

## Common Mistakes
- Using inefficient algorithms for large input
- Forgetting sorting modifies the array

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
- Space Complexity: O(1) or O(n) depending on algorithm
