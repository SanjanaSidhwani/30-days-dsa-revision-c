# 30 Days of DSA Revision in C and C++

This repository documents my structured 30-day revision journey
to strengthen Data Structures and Algorithms fundamentals using
both **C and C++**, with a strong focus on LeetCode problem-solving
patterns and technical interview preparation.

## Purpose
- Revise core DSA concepts systematically
- Practice LeetCode problems pattern-wise
- Write clean, efficient, interview-ready C and C++ code
- Improve time and space complexity analysis

## Repository Structure
- Each folder represents one day of focused revision
- Every day contains:
  - Core concept implementations (primarily in C or C++)
  - Selected LeetCode problems (implemented in C++)
  - Short READMEs covering problem intuition, approach, patterns, and pitfalls

## Focus Areas
- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Trees, Heaps, Graphs
- Sorting, Searching, and Hashing
- Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming
- Common LeetCode patterns (prefix sum, two pointers, sliding window, etc.)

## Note
This repository is intentionally concise and interview-focused.
Detailed learning notes are maintained separately;
this repo reflects final understanding and problem-solving clarity.
