# 30 Days of DSA Revision in C

This repository documents my structured 30-day revision journey
to strengthen Data Structures and Algorithms fundamentals using C,
with a strong focus on LeetCode problem-solving patterns and
technical interview preparation.

## Purpose
- Revise core DSA concepts systematically
- Practice LeetCode problems pattern-wise
- Write clean, efficient, interview-ready C code
- Improve time and space complexity analysis

## Repository Structure
- Each folder represents one day of focused revision
- Every day contains:
  - Core concept implementations in C
  - Selected LeetCode-style problems
  - A short README with key insights and common pitfalls

## Focus Areas
- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Trees, Heaps, Graphs
- Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming
- Common LeetCode patterns (prefix sum, two pointers, sliding window, etc.)

## Progress
- Day 01: Arrays & Time Complexity ✅


## Note
This repository is intentionally concise.
Detailed learning notes are maintained separately;
this repo reflects final understanding and interview-level clarity.
