# Day 1 – Arrays & Time Complexity

## Focus
Revising array fundamentals with emphasis on safe indexing,
loop boundaries, and in-place operations, which form the basis
of most LeetCode array problems.

## Concepts Covered
- Array traversal and indexing
- In-place array manipulation
- Loop boundary conditions
- Basic time and space complexity analysis

## Patterns Covered
- Linear Traversal
- Two Pointers (in-place operations)
- Brute Force (baseline correctness)

## Problems Implemented
### Core Array Problems
- Reverse an array (in-place)
- Find maximum element in an array

### LeetCode Problems
- **Two Sum** (Brute Force approach)
- **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**

## Key Learnings
- Incorrect loop boundaries are a common source of logical bugs
- Brute-force solutions help establish correctness before optimization
- Tracking state during a single traversal can eliminate nested loops
- In-place solutions are preferred when space optimization is required

## Notes
This day focused on strengthening array fundamentals and correctness.
These concepts directly support prefix sum, two pointers, and sliding
window patterns used extensively in LeetCode problems.
