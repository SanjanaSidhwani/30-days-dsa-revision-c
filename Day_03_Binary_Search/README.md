# Day 3 – Binary Search

## Focus
Mastering binary search as a divide-and-conquer technique to efficiently
search in sorted data and reason about boundaries.

## Concepts Covered
- Binary search on sorted arrays
- Mid-point calculation and overflow safety
- Loop boundary conditions
- Leftmost and rightmost occurrence patterns

## Patterns Covered
- Binary Search
- Divide and Conquer
- Boundary-Based Search

## Problems Solved

### Core Concept
- Binary search basics (iterative implementation)

### LeetCode Problems
- **704 – Binary Search**
- **35 – Search Insert Position**
- **34 – Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array**

## Key Learnings
- Correct loop boundaries are critical for binary search correctness
- Binary search can be adapted beyond simple element lookup
- Many “position finding” problems reduce to modified binary search

## Notes
Binary search is a high-frequency interview topic and forms the foundation
for more advanced searching and optimization problems.
